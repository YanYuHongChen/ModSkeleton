## Goals

- To be a go-to example for Unreal Engine 4 modding support.
- To not require core engine changes - work with prebuilt UE4 Editor from Epig Games Launcher.

## Get it Running (Scripted)

1. Download NodeJS - https://nodejs.org
1. Clone the Repo
1. Run the build script once to generate a config: `node ue4build.js`
1. Inspect the config (`.ue4build.json`), if you built ue4 from source, you may need to change the `uatCommand` path.
1. Run the build script again to build: `node ue4build.js`
1. If there are errors, AutomationTool.exe output can be found in the log file specified in `.ue4build.json`
1. If it succeeds, a runable project complete with mod paks should be found in the `outputPath` directory specified in `.ue4build.json`

## Get it Running (Manually)

1. Clone the Repo
1. Open ModSkeleton.uproject
1. Be sure to select "View Options" -> "Show Plugin Content" in the Content browser to see Example Plugin Content
1. Follow [Instruction to Build Custom Launcher Profiles](doc/build_profiles/build_profiles.md)
1. Disable the ModSkeletonExamplePluginA plugin (Edit -> Plugins -> "ModSkeleton" section)
1. Execute the Full Game launch profile for your platform
1. Enable the ModSkeletonExamplePluginA plugin
1. Execute the Mod launch profile for you platform - note this may fail, but not before generating the needed .pak and AssetRegistry files
1. Move/Rename "Plugins/ModSkeletonExamplePluginA/Saved/Cooked/[platform]/ModSkeleton/AssetRegistry.bin" to "Saved/StagedBuilds/[platform]/ModSkeleton/Content/Paks/ModSkeletonExamplePluginA.bin"
1. Move/Rename "Plugins/ModSkeletonExamplePluginA/Saved/StagedBuilds/[platform]/ModSkeleton/Content/Paks/ModSkeleton-[platform].pak" to "Saved/StagedBuilds/[platform]/ModSkeleton/Content/Paks/ModSkeletonExamplePluginA.pak"
1. Execute "Saved/StagedBuilds/[platform]/[ModSkeleton executable]

## Architecture

### Startup

- ModSkeletonGameInstance initializes and keeps a reference to a single ModSkeletonRegistry instance
- ModSkeletonRegistry scans the Content/Paks directory for matching AssetRegistry (".bin") files and Content (".pak") files loading all.
- ModSkeletonRegistry searches the in-memory AssetRegistry for all classes whos name begins with "MOD_SKELETON" and who implement ModSkeletonPluginInterface
- The plugin interface is invoked once as "ModSkeletonInit" allowing these mods to register, connect, and/or invoke mod Hooks.

### ModSkeleton Hooks

- BPVariant is a uobject based blueprint friendly variant class to support easy data interchange through hook invokes
- Hooks marked "Always Invoke" (like the "ModSkeletonInit" hook) will be called once for every loaded MOD_SKELETON init interface
- Hooks NOT marked "Always Invoke" will only be called if they have been Connected, and will be called in priority order
- Hooks will be passed a reference to an array of BPVariants. This "HookIO" will be used as both input and output, and allows hooks to modify core behavior:

Imagine a registered hook that is requesting a list of main menu items. The base game could begin this list with buttons labeled "New Game", "Load Game", and "Exit". Someone could create a mod that adjusts this list, replacing the "New Game" button with one that leads to a different character creation screen. Psuedo Code:

```
class CoreGame implements ModSkeletonPluginInterface
  function ModSkeletonHook(String HookName, BPVariantArray HookIO)
    if HookName == "PopulateMainMenu"
      HookIO[0].Add( NewGameButton )
      HookIO[0].Add( LoadGameButton )
      HookIO[0].Add( ExitButton )
    end if
  end function
end class

class MyNewCharacterMod implements ModSkeletonPluginInterface
  function ModSkeletonHook(String HookName, BPVariantArray HookIO)
    if HookName == "PopulateMainMenu"
      HookIO[0].RemoveItem( NewGameButton )
      HookIO[0].Prepend( MyBetterNewGameButton )
    end if
  end function
end class
```

## TODO

- switch to using `FCoreDelegates::OnMountPak` (I haven't figured out the mountpoint paths with this method)
- Example CPP plugin

## Questions

- Better way to distribute? Could make the core stuff a plugin... but then other plugins would have to depend on headers in it...
- BPVariant blueprint constructor helpers seem a little kludgy (especially with the hidden world context -> outer pins) any way to make that better?
- HookIO TArray< BPVariant* > in-out pins cause more copying than I was hoping for... better way to solve that? I'd like to just modify the passed in reference, but then it shows up as an output on the return node...
